# Complex-Data-Structures-CodeCademy

This project contains the material and programs from Complex Data Structures with Python from CodeCademy.
https://www.codecademy.com/learn/complex-data-structures

Content from the program includes:

##  Hash maps
## Trees
## Heaps
## Graphs

These data structures use a layer of abstraction to make specific operations much more straightforward. They’re designed as solutions for problems that don’t require linear iteration, but have more nuanced requirements.
